Regression Models: Bayesian Ridge and Gaussian Process
This repository demonstrates the implementation and comparison of Bayesian Ridge Regression and Gaussian Process Regression using the housing dataset. These models are explored in terms of their performance with and without regularization, and a comprehensive analysis is provided through various visualizations, including actual vs predicted values, residuals, and distribution comparisons.

Overview
In this project, we use a housing dataset to predict median house values. The primary models used for this task are:

Bayesian Ridge Regression
Gaussian Process Regression
Both models are compared with Ridge Regression (a linear model with L2 regularization). The project explores how regularization impacts model performance and evaluates the effectiveness of different regularization strengths using the alpha parameter in Ridge Regression.

Models Used
1. Bayesian Ridge Regression
Bayesian Ridge Regression is a probabilistic model that performs regularization by assuming that the weights (coefficients) of the regression model follow a Gaussian distribution. It estimates the distribution of the coefficients and uses this information to penalize large values. This regularization happens automatically as the model learns a distribution over the possible values of the regression weights. The result is a more flexible model that can better generalize to unseen data.

How it works:
Unlike traditional ridge regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression automatically learns the regularization term through the data, allowing it to better capture uncertainties in the data and model parameters.
The model is trained by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the coefficients, and regularization is done by restricting the variance of the coefficients.
2. Gaussian Process Regression
Gaussian Process (GP) Regression is a non-parametric model that defines a distribution over functions. It is especially useful for regression problems where we expect a smooth, continuous underlying function but do not know the exact functional form.

How it works:
A Gaussian Process defines a distribution over functions and computes the predictions by conditioning this process on observed data.
The RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel is commonly used in GP to measure the similarity between two data points.
Regularization is introduced by modifying the kernel parameters, such as the length scale, to control the smoothness of the predicted function.
3. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes L2 regularization. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. The strength of the penalty is controlled by the hyperparameter alpha.

Effect of alpha:
No Regularization (alpha=0): The model is more likely to overfit the training data, leading to large coefficients and poor generalization.
Higher alpha values: Larger values of alpha result in stronger regularization, leading to smaller coefficients and better generalization, though the model may underfit if alpha is too high.
Key Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing: Missing values in the dataset were handled by filling missing entries in the total_bedrooms column with the mean value of the column.
Feature Scaling: All features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure they are on the same scale, which is important for regularized models like Ridge and Bayesian Ridge.
Model Training and Evaluation: Models were trained on the data, and performance was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R² (Coefficient of Determination), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Hyperparameter Tuning
For Ridge Regression, hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV, which tested different values of alpha to find the optimal level of regularization. The grid search results were compared against Ridge models with no regularization (alpha=0).

The effect of different alpha values was analyzed, showing how increasing alpha leads to better generalization at the cost of model flexibility.

Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on the following metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions. A lower RMSE indicates better performance.
R² (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. A value closer to 1 indicates better performance.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of the errors without considering their direction.
The evaluation results are displayed using various bar charts that compare the models based on these metrics.

Visualizations
1. Model Performance Comparison


This set of bar charts compares the performance of different models (Bayesian Ridge, Gaussian Process, and Ridge with/without regularization) using RMSE, R², and MAE metrics.

RMSE Comparison: Shows the error magnitude of each model. Lower bars indicate models that make more accurate predictions.
R² Comparison: Demonstrates how well each model explains the variance in the data. Models with higher R² values fit the data better.
MAE Comparison: Shows the average magnitude of the absolute errors. A lower MAE indicates more accurate predictions.
2. Actual vs Predicted Values


This plot shows the relationship between actual and predicted values for the Ridge model with regularization. Points close to the diagonal line indicate good performance, as predictions are close to actual values.

Ridge (With Regularization): Shows how the model with regularization compares to actual values. The closer the points are to the diagonal line, the better the model performs.
3. Residuals Plots


The residual plots show the difference between actual and predicted values. The distribution of residuals helps identify any patterns, which could indicate issues like heteroscedasticity (unequal variance of errors across predicted values).

Ridge Regression Residuals: Ideally, the residuals should be randomly distributed around zero, indicating that the model has captured the underlying pattern of the data effectively.
4. Prediction Distribution


This histogram compares the predicted values across different models. The distributions help understand the spread of the model predictions and assess whether the model is biased towards certain values.

Gaussian Process Predictions: Shows how the Gaussian Process model's predictions are distributed. A wider spread can indicate that the model is uncertain about its predictions.
5. Comparison of All Models' Predictions


This scatter plot compares the predictions from all models against the actual values. Each model’s predictions should ideally lie on the diagonal line if they are accurate.

Conclusion
Regularization improves model performance by preventing overfitting. Ridge and Bayesian Ridge benefit from automatic regularization, while Gaussian Process can be regularized through kernel modifications.
Hyperparameter tuning (specifically the alpha parameter in Ridge) plays a crucial role in model performance.
Gaussian Process is a powerful model for non-linear data but can be computationally expensive.
Bayesian Ridge offers a probabilistic approach to regularization and often works well when the underlying data is noisy or has uncertainties.
