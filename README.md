Regression Models: Ridge, Bayesian, and Gaussian Process
This project demonstrates the implementation of Ridge Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression, and Gaussian Process Regression models on a housing dataset, with a focus on understanding the effects of regularization (alpha values) on model performance. The goal is to explore how each model handles regularization and how they differ in terms of predictive accuracy and model behavior.

Introduction
This project focuses on understanding the effects of regularization on various regression models, specifically:

Ridge Regression
Bayesian Ridge Regression
Gaussian Process Regression
The models are evaluated using the housing dataset, which contains various features related to housing prices, with the target variable being the median house value. The goal is to assess how different regularization strengths (alpha values) impact model performance.

Models Explained
Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a linear regression model that applies L2 regularization (Tikhonov regularization) to the regression coefficients. Regularization penalizes large coefficient values, thus preventing overfitting and helping the model generalize better.

Bayesian Ridge Regression
Bayesian Ridge Regression is a probabilistic linear regression model that places a Gaussian prior on the coefficients. It estimates the posterior distribution of the coefficients, which makes it more robust to outliers.

Regularization in Bayesian Ridge Regression is controlled by two parameters:

alpha_1: Prior precision on the coefficients (controls regularization strength).
alpha_2: Prior precision on the noise (controls the uncertainty in the data).
Gaussian Process Regression
Gaussian Process Regression is a non-parametric model that assumes the underlying function is drawn from a Gaussian Process. It models the data using a kernel function that defines the covariance between data points. Regularization in Gaussian Process Regression is controlled by the parameter alpha, which determines the level of noise.

Effect of Regularization
Ridge Regularization
Ridge regression is sensitive to the choice of alpha. When α is set to a high value, the model’s coefficients are strongly regularized, resulting in underfitting. On the other hand, when α is set to a low value, the model’s coefficients are less regularized, leading to overfitting if the model is too complex. This is visible in the model's performance and residuals.

Key Observation: As the alpha value increases, the model becomes simpler with smaller coefficients, reducing variance but increasing bias.

Bayesian Regularization
In Bayesian Ridge Regression, regularization is controlled by both alpha_1 and alpha_2, which influence the precision of the prior on the coefficients and the noise. The effect of regularization can be seen by changing these parameters:

Higher values of alpha_1 result in stronger regularization, leading to smaller coefficient estimates.
Higher values of alpha_2 decrease the model’s uncertainty about the noise, which can result in less smoothing of predictions.
Key Observation: The choice of regularization directly impacts the smoothness of the predictions and the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.

Gaussian Regularization
For Gaussian Process Regression, regularization is controlled by alpha, which represents the noise level in the model. As alpha increases, the model becomes more robust to noise, leading to smoother predictions. However, higher values of alpha may lead to underfitting, while lower values may allow the model to capture more noise and overfit the data.

Key Observation: As alpha increases, the model’s predictions become smoother and less sensitive to small fluctuations in the data.

Graphs & Visualization

Actual vs Predicted
This section includes graphs comparing the actual target values (housing prices) to the predicted values from each model. By plotting the predicted values against the actual values, we can visually assess the performance of each model.


In the Ridge Regression plot, the predicted values (dashed lines) should closely follow the actual values (solid line), showing how well the model captures the data.
Residuals Plot
Residuals are the differences between the predicted and actual values. A residuals plot helps us assess if the model is underfitting or overfitting. Ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, with no discernible pattern. A clear pattern in residuals may indicate a model that is overfitting or underfitting.


In the residuals plot for Bayesian Ridge Regression, if the residuals are evenly distributed around zero, the model is performing well. Large deviations or systematic patterns indicate potential problems with the model’s fit.
Prediction Distribution Comparison
This graph compares the distributions of predictions from different models. By visualizing the spread of predictions, we can compare how each model handles uncertainty and regularization. This is useful to understand how each model adapts to different levels of regularization and the noise in the data.


The histogram for Bayesian Ridge Regression may show a narrow distribution of predictions when regularization is strong (higher alpha values), indicating that the model is confident in its predictions.
Performance Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² Score. RMSE measures the average deviation between actual and predicted values, while R² quantifies the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Evaluation Metrics:
RMSE: Lower values indicate better model accuracy.
R²: Higher values indicate better fit.
Installation and Requirements
To run the code, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
You will also need the housing.csv dataset. Ensure the dataset is in the appropriate location in the directory before running the code.

Conclusion
This project provides a detailed exploration of three different regression models—Ridge, Bayesian Ridge, and Gaussian Process Regression—and their behavior under varying levels of regularization. Regularization is crucial for preventing overfitting and ensuring that the models generalize well to new data. The visualizations and performance metrics help to analyze how the models perform with different regularization strengths and how they differ in terms of prediction accuracy and residuals.

By experimenting with different regularization parameters (alpha, alpha_1, alpha_2), you can see how each model adjusts its behavior to balance bias and variance.
